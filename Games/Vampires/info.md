# Vampires #


## Brief Description ##

Use your only weapon, a torch, to destory vampires by shining it on them.
Hunt down all the vampires through all their domains until you rid the world of them.


## Mechanics ##

### Core Mechanic ###

Point the torch. Player will only have a torch to hunt vampires throughout the whole game.

The torch is a wind-up torch so will run out of power if used for too long. Player will need
to turn it of and spend some time winding to charge it again.

### Secondary Mechanic ####

#### Mirrors ####

Throughout the levels there will be mirrors which can be used to send the torch light around corners.
Some mirrors will be moveable, allowing the player to plot the torch beam.

There will also be other reflective objects specific to domain. This such as metal doors,
wet walls, gems.

#### Soft Shoes / Line of Sight ####

Player has an exceptionally soft tread, meaning vampires will not be able to hear any approach.
However if a vampire sees you he will attack. Play can then hide to stop the pursuit.


## Progression ##

### Domains ###

Each *level* revolves around a single main vampire and his flock. This main vampire will have a unique
domain, e.g. swamp, castle, caves, skyscraper, forest

### Areas ###

Each domain is broken down into areas, e.g. rooms, floors, caves, section of forest.

Each area will contain some of the flock of the main vampire.

Not all of the flock needs to be destroyed to move on to the next area. If you move onto
the next area leaves some flock vampires behind, they can follow you into subsequent areas.
Not all of the flock, and not immediately, but some may find there way through to you.
So simply running through each areas to the *Arena* may not be the best choice, as the flock
will follow you and make it even harder.

### Arena ###

Arena is the last area in a domain. Here will me the main vampire for the domain who
will need to be destroyed to get out of the domain. 

Once the main vampire is destroyed his flock will be destroyed.

The health of the main vampiure is influenced by the number in his flock. The more in the flock
the harder he is to destroy.


## Narrative ##

Wouldn't you know it, almost everyone has been converted to a vampire. It started with a man
named Yugo who returned home one day as a vampire and killed his family. Nobody know the cause.

When a vampire bite a person, the person comes part of his flock.

There are several main vampires, each with a flock. Nobody knows where these main vampires came from,
or how they came to be.

The player is Erich, who discovers the secret of how the main vampires came about.
He takes the special torch and sets out to stop all the main vampires.
