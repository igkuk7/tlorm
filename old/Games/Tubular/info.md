## Brief Description ##

Quickly rewire the bomb to stop it exploding!


## Mechanics ##

### Core Mechanic ###

Switch the wires. Player can adjust the start/end point of certain wires. They need to do this 
to make the colours match up from start to end in order to diffuse the bomb.

### Secondary Mechanic ####

#### Timer ####

It's a bomb, so there is a time limit on some. This is triggered from the first touch.

#### No Mistakes ####

Once rewired the player must commit to the changes. This will "activate" the bomb
and if the rewiring is incorrect, the bomb will explode. This will not
happen in controlled environments, only once the bombs are live.

#### Find the Bomb? ####

Later in the game, the player will receive clues from the serial bomber as to bomb location.
This will be like a point'n'click game for the player to follow the clues to uncover the bomb.


## Progression ##

### Number of Wires ###

As the bombs get more sophisticate, the number of wires to sort through will increase.

### Bomb Size ###

The bigger the bomb the more rewirings to do.

### Experience ###

The more bombs you diffuse and the quicker you do it, will gain you more experience.
Experience gives you extra advantages when working on a bomb, e.g. focus (will allow you to
hide other wires and focus on a single ones), calmness (will allow you to move a previously
unmoveable wire), gut/hunch (will give you a glimpse of the correct rewiring for a single wire)
